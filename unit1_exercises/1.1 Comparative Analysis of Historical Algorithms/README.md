# Exercise 1.1: Comparative Analysis of Historical Algorithms

## Task:

Research and implement Euclid's algorithm and another historical algorithm (e.g., the Sieve of Eratosthenes) in Rust. Compare their time and space complexities using Big O notation.

## Objective:

Understand the foundations of algorithm design and analyze the efficiency of different algorithms in terms of time and space complexity.

## Deliverables:

Rust code for both algorithms and a report on their historical significance, Big O notation analysis, and modern applicability.
