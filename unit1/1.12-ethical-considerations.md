# Ethical Considerations of Algorithm Design

Task: Examine the ethical considerations in algorithm design, focusing on bias and fairness. Discuss how algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate biases, and explore techniques in Rust for creating fair and unbiased algorithms.

Algorithmic bias creeps in whenever data, assumptions, or objectives reflect historical—or unintended—inequities. Left unchecked, even “neutral” code can systematically disadvantage certain groups. Below is a quick tour of where bias comes from, how to mitigate it, and concrete Rust examples for measuring—and correcting—fairness in a simple classifier pipeline.

## 1. Where Bias & Unfairness Arise

1. **Biased training data**

   * Historical prejudices (e.g. hiring data that under-hired a demographic) get baked into models.
   * Sampling artifacts (“street cameras” vs. “office cameras”) skew distributions.

2. **Proxy features**

   * Seemingly innocuous fields (zip code, education level) often correlate with protected attributes (race, gender).

3. **Objective misalignment**

   * Optimizing purely for accuracy or profit can sacrifice fairness metrics (e.g. disparate impact).

4. **Feedback loops**

   * If a recommender shows certain groups fewer opportunities, future data will reinforce the bias.

---

## 2. Fairness Strategies

1. **Pre-processing**

   * **Reweighing**: assign higher sample weights to under-represented groups.
   * **Data transformation**: remove or mask proxies for sensitive attributes.

2. **In-processing**

   * **Fairness-constrained optimization**: add penalty terms for unfairness (e.g. statistical parity gap) into the loss function.
   * **Adversarial debiasing**: train a model to both predict the target and prevent an adversary from recovering the sensitive attribute.

3. **Post-processing**

   * **Threshold adjustment**: use different decision thresholds per group to equalize false-positive or false-negative rates.
   * **Calibrated equal odds**: randomly flip a small fraction of decisions to satisfy fairness constraints.

## 3. Measuring Fairness in Rust

Below is a minimal Rust snippet to compute **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)**—the difference in positive-prediction rates between an unprivileged group and a privileged group—and then to adjust decision thresholds per group.

```rust
/// Compute Statistical Parity Difference:
/// P(ŷ=1 | group=false) – P(ŷ=1 | group=true)
fn statistical_parity_difference(preds: &[bool], groups: &[bool]) -> f64 {
    assert_eq!(preds.len(), groups.len());
    let (mut pos_priv, mut ct_priv, mut pos_unpriv, mut ct_unpriv) =
        (0usize, 0usize, 0usize, 0usize);

    for (&pred, &grp) in preds.iter().zip(groups.iter()) {
        if grp {
            ct_priv += 1;
            if pred { pos_priv += 1; }
        } else {
            ct_unpriv += 1;
            if pred { pos_unpriv += 1; }
        }
    }

    let rate_priv = pos_priv as f64 / ct_priv as f64;
    let rate_unpriv = pos_unpriv as f64 / ct_unpriv as f64;
    rate_unpriv - rate_priv
}

/// Apply different thresholds for each group:
/// `scores`: raw model scores (0.0–1.0), `groups`: sensitive attribute flags
/// `th_priv` and `th_unpriv` are group-specific cutoffs.
fn apply_group_thresholds(
    scores: &[f64],
    groups: &[bool],
    th_priv: f64,
    th_unpriv: f64,
) -> Vec<bool> {
    assert_eq!(scores.len(), groups.len());
    scores.iter()
        .zip(groups.iter())
        .map(|(&score, &grp)| {
            if grp { score >= th_priv } else { score >= th_unpriv }
        })
        .collect()
}

fn main() {
    // Example data: 10 instances
    let scores = vec![0.9, 0.2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.05];
    let groups = vec![true, true, false, false, true, false, true, false, true, false];

    // Baseline predictions at threshold = 0.5
    let preds: Vec<bool> = scores.iter().map(|&s| s >= 0.5).collect();
    let spd_baseline = statistical_parity_difference(&preds, &groups);
    println!("Baseline SPD = {:.3}", spd_baseline);

    // Adjust thresholds to try to reduce SPD
    let preds_adj = apply_group_thresholds(&scores, &groups, /*priv*/0.6, /*unpriv*/0.4);
    let spd_adj = statistical_parity_difference(&preds_adj, &groups);
    println!("Adjusted SPD = {:.3}", spd_adj);
}
```

**What this shows:**

* **Measuring SPD** tells you whether one group is systematically more likely to receive positive outcomes.
* **Threshold tuning** is a simple post-processing fix: raising the bar for the privileged group, lowering it for the unprivileged group, to bring their positive rates closer together.

## 4. Rust-Specific Fairness Practices

1. **Strong Typing of Sensitive Attributes**
   Encapsulate sensitive fields in dedicated types (e.g. `enum Gender { Male, Female, Nonbinary }`) so it’s hard to accidentally drop or misuse them.

2. **Audit Trails & Logging**
   Use Rust’s `log` or tracing crates to record feature importances and per-group metrics at each stage (data load, training, inference), enabling post-hoc bias audits.

3. **Immutable Data Pipelines**
   Leverage `Iterator` adapters and pure functions so that data transformations are transparent and reviewable—no hidden side-effects.

4. **Crate Ecosystem**
   While dedicated fairness crates in Rust are nascent, you can build on existing statistical and ML crates—e.g. `ndarray`, `smartcore`—to implement pre-, in-, and post-processing steps with full control over biases.

### In Practice

* **Combine techniques**: measuring SPD is a start, but you may also want to track **Equalized Odds** (difference in true positive/false positive rates) or **Predictive Parity** (precision gap).
* **End-to-end checks**: bake fairness tests into your CI pipeline—e.g. “SPD must be < 0.1.”
* **Human-in-the-loop reviews**: let domain experts inspect feature importances and per-group performance before deployment.

By raising fairness from an afterthought to a first-class concern—measuring bias, encoding sensitive attributes explicitly, and applying mitigation strategies—you can write Rust code that’s not only fast and safe, but also socially responsible.
